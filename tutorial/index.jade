      ## What Does This Thing Do?

      This [Sinatra](//www.sinatrarb.com/) sample application
      demonstrates how to send SMS alerts to a list of system
      administrators if something goes wrong on your server. On this
      tutorial we'll show you the key bits of code to make this work.
      Head to the [application's
      README.md](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/server-notifications-sinatra)
      to see how to run the application locally.

      Let's get started!

      ## Configure Twilio Client

      To send messages we'll need to create a Twilio REST client which requires
      reading the environment variables `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
      from our enviroment.

      ## List Server Admins

      Here we create a list of administrators who should be notified if a
      server error occurs.  The only essential piece of data we need is a
      `phone_number` for each administrator.

      ## Handle All the Exceptions in the Application

      Here we implement error handling and message delivery using
      [Sinatra Errors Handlers](//github.com/sul-dlss/sdr-services-app/blob/master/Sinatra-error-handling.md).
      We will also make all the Twilio API calls from here.

      ## Trigger Notifications for Administrators List

      In our `Notifier` module, we read the administrators from our YAML file
      and send alert messages to each one of them with the method `send_sms`.

      ## Send a Text Message

      There are the three parameters needed to [send an
      SMS](//www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/ruby/sms/sending-via-rest)
      using the [Twilio REST API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest): `from`, `to`, and
      `body`. [US and Canadian phone numbers](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/sms/is-mms-supported-for-all-carriers-in-us-and-canada)
      can also send an image with the message.

      ## Where to Next?

      That's it! We've just implemented an automated server notification system
      that can send you server alerts if anything goes wrong. If you're a Ruby
      developer working with Twilio, you might want to check out these other
      tutorials.
